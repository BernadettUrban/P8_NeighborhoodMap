For helping me to integrate React with a Google Maps, I have been following some instructions and tips from this Blog post:
  - [How to Write a Google Maps React Component](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/)

I used some scripts from the tutorial, I copy them from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/auser/1d55aa3897f15d17caf21dc39b85b663):
  - [GoogleAPI.js](https://gist.github.com/auser/1d55aa3897f15d17caf21dc39b85b663#file-googleapi-js)
  - [GoogleAPIComponent.js](https://gist.github.com/auser/1d55aa3897f15d17caf21dc39b85b663#file-googleapicomponent-js)
